<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Ethiopia due to the potential for civil unrest and arbitrary detention.<p>There continue to be reports of unrest, particularly in the Gondar region and Bahir Dar in Amhara State, and parts of Oromia State. This replaces the Travel Warning of June 13, 2017.</p><p>The Government of Ethiopia has demonstrated its ability and willingness to restrict or shut down internet, cellular data, and phone services, impeding the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s ability to communicate with U.S. citizens in Ethiopia and limiting the Embassy&#8217;s ability to provide consular services. Additionally, the Government of Ethiopia does not inform the U.S. Embassy of detentions or arrests of U.S. citizens in Ethiopia.</p><p>Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings, continuously assess your surroundings, and evaluate your personal level of safety. Be aware&nbsp; that the government may use force and live fire in response to demonstrations, and that even gatherings intended to be peaceful can be met with a violent response or turn violent without warning. U.S. citizens in Ethiopia should monitor their security situation and have contingency plans in place in case you need to depart suddenly.</p><p>Given the unpredictable security situation, U.S. citizens in Ethiopia should have alternate communication plans in place, and let family and friends know that communication may be limited while you are in Ethiopia.&nbsp; The Department of State strongly advises U.S. citizens to&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/ethiopia-travel-warning.html">register</a> your mobile number with the U.S. Embassy to receive security information via text or SMS, in addition to enrolling in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/ethiopia.html">Country Specific Information for Ethiopia</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)&nbsp;</a>to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://et.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa</a>, located at Entoto Street, P.O.

<title>Bangladesh Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:06:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/bangladesh-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/bangladesh-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of continuing threats from terrorist groups in Bangladesh and to consider the risks of travel to and throughout the country.  <p>The Department is updating this travel warning to reflect the change in the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka&#8217;s status to &#8220;partially accompanied,&#8221; effective August 24, 2017, allowing all spouses/partners of U.S. government personnel to remain in or return to Dhaka. Previously, only adult family members employed by the U.S. government were permitted to remain or return to Dhaka. Minor dependents are still prohibited from residing in Dhaka. The U.S. Embassy remains open and will provide all consular services. This travel warning replaces the travel warning dated January 5, 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>While Bangladeshi security forces continue to identify and counter terrorist elements, the Islamic State of Iraq and ash Sham (ISIS) and al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) persist in their efforts to plot and/or carry out terrorist attacks throughout the country. In March, two suicide bombing attempts occurred at Dhaka&#8217;s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and an explosion in the city of Sylhet killed seven people. These incidents were the first notable attacks since July 1, 2016, when terrorists killed more than 20 people, including one U.S. citizen, in a restaurant frequented by foreigners in Dhaka's diplomatic enclave.</p><p>In October 2016, ISIS threatened to target &quot;expats, tourists, diplomats, garment buyers, missionaries, and sports teams&quot; in the most &quot;secured zones&quot; in Bangladesh. Recurring threats and periodic terrorist activities have prompted the Embassy to require U.S. government personnel in Bangladesh to live, work, and travel under strict security guidelines. The internal security policies of the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh may be changed or adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p><p>U.S. government officials and their adult family members are not permitted to travel on foot, motorcycle, bicycle, rickshaw, or other uncovered means on public thoroughfares and sidewalks in Bangladesh. In addition, U.S. government officials and their family members remain severely restricted in their ability to visit public establishments and places or to attend large gatherings in Bangladesh. U.S. citizens should take stringent security measures, remain vigilant, and be alert to local security developments.&nbsp;</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the State Department's <a href="/content/travel/en.html">travel website</a> for the Worldwide Caution, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and <a href="/content/passports/en/country/bangladesh.html">Country Specific Information</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the <a href="/content/passports/en/go/step.html">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact the <a href="https://bd.usembassy.gov/embassy/">U.S. Embassy in Dhaka</a>, Bangladesh, located at Madani Avenue, Baridhara, Dhaka, Bangladesh 1212, at (88) (02) 5566-2000, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.

<title>Mexico Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 09:37:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens about the risk of traveling to certain parts of Mexico due to the activities of criminal organizations in those areas.  <p>U.S. citizens have been the victims of violent crimes, including homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery in various Mexican states. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning for Mexico issued December 8, 2016.</p><p>For information on security conditions in specific regions of Mexico, see our state-by-state assessments below. U.S. government personnel and their families are prohibited from personal travel to all areas to which the Department recommends &#8220;defer non-essential travel&#8221; in this Travel Warning. As a result of security precautions that U.S. government personnel must take while traveling to parts of Mexico, our response time to emergencies involving U.S. citizens may be hampered or delayed.&nbsp;</p><p>Gun battles between rival criminal organizations or with Mexican authorities have taken place on streets and in public places during broad daylight. The Mexican government dedicates substantial resources to protect visitors to major tourist destinations and has engaged in an extensive effort to counter criminal organizations that engage in narcotics trafficking and other unlawful activities throughout Mexico. There is no evidence that criminal organizations have targeted U.S. citizens based on their nationality. Resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the level of drug-related violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes.</p><p>U.S. government personnel are prohibited from patronizing adult clubs and gambling establishments in the states of Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Jalisco, Colima, and Nayarit.&nbsp;</p><p>Kidnappings in Mexico take the following forms:</p><ul><li><b>Traditional:</b>&nbsp; victim is physically abducted and held captive until a ransom is paid for release.</li><li><b>Express:</b>&nbsp; victim is abducted for a short time and commonly forced to withdraw money, usually from an ATM, then released.</li><li><b>Virtual:&nbsp;</b> an extortion-by-deception scheme where a victim is contacted by phone and coerced by threats of violence to provide phone numbers of family and friends, and then isolated until the ransom is paid.&nbsp; Recently, hotel guests have been targets of such &quot;virtual&quot; kidnapping schemes.</li></ul><p>U.S. citizens have been murdered in carjackings and highway robberies, most frequently at night and on isolated roads. Carjackers use a variety of techniques, including roadblocks, bumping/moving vehicles to force them to stop, and running vehicles off the road at high speeds. There are indications that criminals target newer and larger vehicles, but drivers of old sedans and buses coming from the United States are also targeted. U.S. government personnel are not permitted to drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to or from the interior parts of Mexico. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from intercity travel after dark in many areas of Mexico. U.S. citizens should use toll roads (cuotas) whenever possible. In remote areas, cell phone coverage is limited or non-existent.</p><p>The Mexican government has deployed federal police and military personnel throughout the country as part of its efforts to combat organized criminal groups.&nbsp; U.S. citizens traveling on Mexican roads and highways by car or bus may encounter government checkpoints, staffed by military or law enforcement personnel. In some places, criminal organizations have erected their own unauthorized checkpoints, at times wearing police and military uniforms, and have killed or abducted motorists who have failed to stop at them. You should cooperate at all checkpoints.</p><p><b>State-by-State Assessment: </b>Below is a state-by-state assessment of security conditions throughout Mexico. Travelers should be mindful that even if no advisories are in effect for a given state, U.S. citizens should exercise caution throughout Mexico as crime and violence can still occur. For general information about travel and other conditions in Mexico, see our <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/mexico.html">Country Specific Information</a>.</p><p><b>Aguascalientes:</b> Intercity travel at night is prohibited for U.S. government personnel.</p><p><b>Baja California (includes Tijuana, Rosarito, Ensenada, Tecate, and Mexicali):</b> Exercise caution in the northern state of Baja California, particularly at night. Criminal activity and violence, including homicide, remain an issue throughout the state. According to the Baja California State Secretariat for Public Security, the state of Baja California experienced an increase in homicide rates compared to the same period in 2016. While most of these homicides appeared to be targeted, criminal organization assassinations, turf battles between criminal groups have resulted in violent crime in areas frequented by U.S. citizens. Shooting incidents injuring innocent bystanders have occurred during daylight hours. Due to poor cellular service and general road conditions, U.S. government personnel are only allowed to travel on &#8220;La Rumorosa&#8221; between Mexicali-Tijuana on the toll road during daylight hours.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Baja California Sur (includes Los Cabos and La Paz):&nbsp;</b>Criminal activity and violence, including homicide, remain an issue throughout the state. Exercise caution as Baja California Sur continues to experience a high rate of homicides. According to Government of Mexico statistics, the state of Baja California Sur experienced an increase in homicide rates compared to the same period in 2016.

U.S. government personnel may travel outside of the city of Durango only during daylight hours on toll roads. Between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., U.S. government personnel must abide by the Embassy-imposed curfew and remain within the city of Durango.</p><p><b>Estado de Mexico (includes Toluca and Teotihuacan):</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens should defer all non-essential travel to the municipalities of Coacalco, Ecatepec, Nezahualcoyotl, La Paz, Valle del Chalco, Solidaridad, Chalco, Ixtapaluca, and Tlatlaya due to high rates of crime and insecurity, unless traveling directly through the areas on major thoroughfares.

<title>Iran Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 22:42:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/iran-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/iran-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>
IR</dc:identifier>
<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Iran.<p>This replaces the Travel Warning for Iran dated August 22, 2016, to reiterate and highlight the risk of arrest and detention for U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans. Foreigners, in particular dual nationals of Iran and other countries, including the United States, continue to be detained or prevented from leaving Iran. U.S. citizens should very carefully weigh the risks of and consider postponing planned travel to Iran. U.S. citizens residing in Iran should closely follow media reports, monitor local conditions, and evaluate the risks of remaining in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly Iranian-Americans, including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics, on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities have also prevented the departure, in some cases for months, of a number of Iranian-American citizens who traveled to Iran for personal or professional reasons.</p><p>In June 2017, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it would take &#8220;reciprocal action&#8221; in response to the implementation of Executive Order 13780.&nbsp; This Executive Order prohibits the issuance of U.S. visas to nationals of Iran and five other countries unless they are either exempt or are issued a waiver. The Department of State has received reports that Iran is denying visas to U.S. citizens in response.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with Iran and, therefore, cannot provide protection or routine consular services to U.S. citizens there. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran. The range of consular services provided by the Foreign Interests Section at the Swiss Embassy is limited and may require significantly more processing time than at U.S. embassies or consulates.&nbsp;</p><p>The Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will not allow the Swiss to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals.&nbsp; Iranian authorities make the determination of a dual national&#8217;s Iranian citizenship without regard to the dual national&#8217;s personal wishes. Consular access to detained U.S. citizens without dual nationality is often delayed.&nbsp;</p><p>The Iranian government continues to repress minority religious and ethnic groups, including Christians, Baha'i, Arabs, Kurds, Azeris, and others. Consequently, some areas within the country where these minorities reside, including the province of Sistan-Baluchistan near the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan and the provinces of Kurdistan and East-Azerbaijan in the northwest of the country near the Iraqi border, remain unsafe. Iranian authorities have detained and harassed U.S. citizens, particularly those of Iranian origin. Former Muslims who have converted to other religions, religious activists, and persons who encourage Muslims to convert are subject to arrest and prosecution. See the Department of State&#8217;s <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/">International Religious Freedom Report</a> and <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> for more information on the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities in Iran.</p><p>The U.S. government is concerned about the risks to civil aircraft flying into, out of, within, or over Iran due to hazards from military activity associated with the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.

<title>North Korea Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 18:40:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/north-korea-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/north-korea-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State strongly warns U.S. citizens not to travel to North Korea/the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK).<p>Due to the serious and mounting risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. citizens, the Secretary of State restricted the use of U.S. passports to travel into, in, or through North Korea effective Friday, September 1, 2017, per <a href="https://www.govregs.com/regulations/title22_chapterI_subpartE_section51.63">C.F.R. 51.63</a>. Persons who wish to travel to North Korea on a U.S. passport after that time must obtain a special passport validation under <a href="https://www.govregs.com/regulations/title22_chapterI_part51_subpartE_section51.64">22 C.F.R. 51.64</a>, and such validations will be granted only under very limited circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This notice includes information about the restriction on the use of U.S. passports to travel to, through, or in North Korea effective September 1, 2017, and replaces the Travel Warning dated May 9, 2017.</p><p>North Korean authorities have imposed unduly harsh sentences for actions that would not be considered crimes in the United States and have threatened U.S. citizen detainees with being treated in accordance with &#8220;wartime law of the DPRK.&#8221; Since the United States does not maintain diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea, the U.S. government has no means to provide normal consular services to U.S. citizens in North Korea.&nbsp; Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency consular services to U.S. citizens traveling in North Korea. The DPRK still routinely delays or denies consular access to U.S. citizens, even when requested by the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, and despite North Korea and the United States both being signatories to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.</p><p>At least 16 U.S. citizens have been detained in North Korea in the past ten years. North Korean authorities have detained individuals who traveled independently and those who were part of organized tours. Being a member of a group tour or using a tour guide will not prevent detention or arrest. Efforts by private tour operators to prevent or resolve past detentions in the DPRK have not been successful.</p><p>Pursuant to the Secretary of State&#8217;s determination, published in the Federal Register on August 2, 2017, that North Korea&#8217;s arbitrary system of law enforcement poses an imminent danger to the physical safety of U.S. nationals, U.S. passports may be used to travel into, through, or from North Korea after September 1, 2017, only if they contain a special validation. Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/news/north-korea-travel-restriction.html" title="Passport for Travel to North Korea">Passport for Travel to North Korea</a>&nbsp;for more information. Using a U.S. passport in violation of these restrictions could result in criminal penalties. In addition, the Department may revoke a passport used in violation of these restrictions. For additional information on the validation see the Federal Register published <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/02/2017-16286/notice-of-information-collection-under-omb-emergency-review-request-for-approval-to-travel-to-a">here</a>. If you decide to enter North Korea, you should have no expectation of privacy. All electronic and multimedia devices including USB drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, Internet browsing histories, and cookies are subject to search for banned content.</p><p>If DPRK authorities permit you to keep your mobile phone when you enter the country, it will not function unless you use the DPRK mobile service, which will enable DPRK authorities to monitor your calls. GPS-trackers and satellite phones are not allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>Possession of any media, either physical or electronic, that is critical of the DPRK government or its leaders is considered a criminal act punishable by long-term detention in hard labor camps and heavy fines.&nbsp;</p><p>In North Korea, the following &#8211; whether done knowingly or unknowingly &#8211; have been treated as crimes:</p><ul><li>Showing disrespect to the country&#8217;s former leaders, Kim Il Sung or Kim Jong Il, or the country&#8217;s current leader, Kim Jong Un, including but not limited to tampering with or mishandling materials bearing their names or images;</li><li>Entering North Korea without proper travel documentation;</li><li>Possessing material that is in any way critical of the DPRK government;</li><li>Proselytizing or carrying out religious activities, including activities that may be construed as such, like leaving behind religious materials;</li><li>Engaging in unsanctioned political activities;</li><li>Traveling without authorization, even for short distances; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Having unauthorized interaction with the local population;</li><li>Exchanging currency with an unauthorized vendor;</li><li>Taking unauthorized photographs;</li><li>Bringing pornography into the country;</li><li>Shopping at stores not designated for foreigners; and</li><li>Removing or tampering with political slogans and signs or pictures of political leaders.</li></ul><p>Numerous foreigners have been held in North Korea for extended periods of time without being formally charged with a crime. Detained foreigners have been questioned daily for several weeks without the presence of counsel and have been compelled to make public statements and take part in public trials.</p><p>The DPRK funnels revenue from a variety of sources to its nuclear and weapons programs, which it prioritizes above everything else, often at the expense of the well-being of its own people. It is entirely possible that money spent by tourists in the DPRK goes to fund these programs.&nbsp; We would urge all travelers, before travelling to the DPRK, to consider what they might be supporting. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The DPRK remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world.&nbsp; U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea should familiarize themselves with all applicable sanctions relating to the country, particularly U.S. sanctions. To learn more about U.S. sanctions on the DPRK, see the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/nkorea.aspx#legal">Department of Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</a><u>.</u></p><p>The Department of State remains deeply concerned about the DPRK&#8217;s ongoing, systematic, and widespread human rights violations. To learn more about North Korea&#8217;s deplorable human rights situation, see the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2016/eap/265344.htm">DPRK Country Report on Human Rights Practices</a> for 2016.</p><p>The United States and the United Nations Security Council have expressed grave concern regarding North Korea&#8217;s recent nuclear tests, ballistic missile launches, and other activities prohibited by United Nations Security Council Resolutions.&nbsp; UN Security Council statements from May 2017 are posted on the <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12821.doc.htm%20and%20https:/www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12831.doc.htm">UN website</a>.</p><p>As a result of concerns arising from unannounced missile launch activities and GPS navigation systems interference and/or disruption, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Prohibition and Advisory notice to U.S. airmen and operators. The FAA has issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 79 which prohibits U.S. civil aviation from flying in the Pyongyang Flight Information Region (FIR) west of 132 degrees east longitude, and the FAA has advised those flying in and around the Pyongyang (FIR)&nbsp; east of 132 degrees east longitude to be aware of possible GPS interruptions. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp; travel website</a>, travel.state.gov, for current <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Cautions</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/korea-north.html">Country Specific Information for North Korea</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive important safety and security messages via email (though you may not have access to email while in North Korea).&nbsp; Enrollment also makes it easier to locate you in case of an emergency.</li><li>U.S. citizens who plan to travel to North Korea are strongly encouraged to inform the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China by enrolling in STEP.&nbsp; U.S. citizens residing in China can contact the U.S. Embassy directly.&nbsp; The Embassy is located next to the Ladies&#8217; Street (Nuren Jie) and Laitai Flower Market, near the Kempinski Hotel and Lufthansa Shopping Center on Tianze Road near the Liangmaqiao subway stop:<ul><li>U.S. Embassy in Beijing<br>American Citizens Services Unit<br>No. 55 An Jia Lou Road<br>Chaoyang District<br>Beijing, China 100600<br>Telephone:&nbsp; (86-10) 8531-4000<br>Email:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:BeijingACS@state.gov">BeijingACS@state.gov<br> </a>Emergency after-hours number for U.S. citizens:&nbsp; (86-10) 8531-4000</li></ul></li><li>U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea are also strongly encouraged to contact the Embassy of Sweden by email prior to travel.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Somalia because of widespread terrorist and criminal activity.  <p>Militants associated with both the al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist group, al-Shabaab, and the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) operate with relative impunity throughout large parts of the country, including Mogadishu, and attack civilian, military, and government targets. U.S. citizens should be aware that kidnapping, bombings, murder, illegal roadblocks and other violent incidents are common throughout Somalia, including Somaliland. There is no U.S. embassy presence in Somalia. This replaces the Travel Warning dated January 11, 2017. &nbsp;</p><p>There is a particular terrorist threat in places where large crowds gather and Westerners frequent, including airports and seaports, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, and shopping areas. Somali government, military, and Western convoys are also regularly targeted for attack. There have been numerous attacks on hotels, restaurants, and the international airport in Mogadishu. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Al-Shabaab has repeatedly attacked Mogadishu&#8217;s international airport complex with improvised vehicle bombs, mortars, and direct weapons fire. The group has conducted attacks from within the airport&#8217;s secure perimeter and detonated an explosive device hidden in a laptop on an airplane shortly after it took off from the airport on February 2, 2016.</p><p>ISIS&#8217;s demonstrated capabilities in Somalia have steadily increased since rising to public prominence in late 2015. Since that time, adherents based in Puntland claimed credit for a suicide bombing targeting regional security forces at a checkpoint in Bosasso, took responsibility for a raid at a popular hotel in that city, and conducted several other attacks against government officials in Puntland in the months prior. The group briefly occupied the coastal town of Qandala in late 2016.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/01/07/2015-33257/prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-territory-and-airspace-of-somalia">Special Federal Aviation Regulation</a> (SFAR) containing information on the U.S. prohibition against U.S. civil aviation operations in airspace over Somalia. For further background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p><p>U.S. citizens should avoid sailing near the coast of Somalia due to the risk of pirate attacks. Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and recreational craft all risk seizure and detention by pirates in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia.&nbsp;See the <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report">Live Piracy Report</a> published by the International Maritime Bureau.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts,</a> and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/somalia.html">Country Specific Information</a> for Somalia. </li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. </li><li>Contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://nairobi.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Nairobi</a> located on United Nations Avenue, Gigiri, Nairobi, at&nbsp; telephone (+254) (20) 363-6451, 7:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 7:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. on Friday.&nbsp; After-hours emergency number for U.S. citizens is (+254) (20) 363-6000.&nbsp; </li><li>Call 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays). </li><li>Follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/travelgov">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/travelgov">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Venezuela due to social unrest, violent crime, and pervasive food and medicine shortages.  <p>This travel warning also informs U.S. citizens that on July 27, the Department ordered the departure of family members and authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. government employees from the U.S. Embassy in Caracas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All U.S. direct-hire personnel and their families assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas are subject to an embassy movement policy that limits their travel within Caracas and many parts of the country.&nbsp; Inter-city travel by car during hours of darkness (6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) is strongly discouraged and in some cases may be prohibited.&nbsp; U.S. government personnel must also request approval for travel outside of Caracas.&nbsp; These security measures may limit the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s ability to provide services.&nbsp; This replaces the Travel Warning issued December 15, 2016.</p><p>The political and security situation in Venezuela is unpredictable and can change quickly.&nbsp; Since April 2017, political rallies and demonstrations occur daily throughout the country, often with little notice.&nbsp; Disruptions to traffic and public transportation are common.&nbsp; Demonstrations typically elicit a strong police and security force response that includes the use of tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons and rubber bullets against participants, and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism. Armed motorcycle gangs associated with the government frequently use violence to intimidate demonstrators.&nbsp; Clashes between these groups have resulted in serious injuries and over 70 deaths.&nbsp; U.S. citizens have reported being arrested, detained, and robbed while in close proximity to protests.</p><p>Security forces have arrested individuals, including U.S. citizens, and detained them for long periods with little or no evidence of a crime.&nbsp; The U.S. Embassy may not be notified of the detention of a U.S. citizen and consular access to detainees may be denied or severely delayed.&nbsp; The detained citizen may be denied access to proper medical care, clean water, and food.</p><p>Violence and criminal activity &#8211; including homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking &#8211; pose significant and continuing security concerns.&nbsp; Indiscriminate violent crime is endemic throughout the country and can occur anywhere at any time.&nbsp; There are reports of authorities (e.g., police, airport, immigration) and criminals posing as authorities participating in robbery and extortion.&nbsp; Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active in the Colombian border states of Zulia, Tachira, and Apure.</p><p>The Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var International Airport, in Maiquet&#237;a, is located in an extremely high-risk area for armed robbery and kidnappings.&nbsp; Do not take unregulated taxis from this airport and avoid ATMs in this area.&nbsp; Travel between the Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var International Airport and Caracas only during daylight hours, as armed bandits frequently target night-time motorists along this route.</p><p>Due to shortages of medicine and medical supplies, U.S. citizens should be prepared to cover their own needs for over-the-counter and prescription medicines while in country.&nbsp; You should have medical evacuation plans in place that do not rely solely on U.S. government assistance.&nbsp; Comprehensive medical evacuation insurance is strongly advised for all travelers.</p><p>U.S. citizens may also be detained and/or deported by Venezuelan immigration officials for not complying with visa or immigration regulations.&nbsp; U.S. citizens traveling to Venezuela must have a valid visa that is appropriate for their specific type of travel (journalism, employment, study, etc.) or risk being detained or deported.&nbsp; Journalists must possess the appropriate accreditation and work visa from the Venezuelan authorities before arriving. International journalists are closely scrutinized and have been expelled and/or detained for lacking appropriate permissions to work in Venezuela or for participation in what could be seen as anti-government activity, including observing and reporting on public health facilities.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/venezuela.html">Venezuela Specific Information</a>.<br><br></li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.<br><br></li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela, located at Calle F con Calle Suapure, Lomas de Valle Arriba, Caracas at +[58] 212-975-6411, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to consider the risks of travel to and throughout Jordan due to persistent terrorist threats. <p>The self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), its affiliates, sympathizers, and other violent extremist groups have successfully conducted attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests, and &#8220;soft&#8221; targets. Jordan's prominent role in the counter &#173;ISIS Coalition and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. This replaces the Travel Warning issued December 23, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>U.S., Western, and official Jordanian interests remain priority targets for ISIS and other violent extremist organizations. Within the last year, Jordanian authorities have notified the U.S. Embassy of several disrupted terrorist plots targeting U.S. citizens and Westerners in Jordan. In addition, on December 18, 2016, terrorists killed 10 people, including a Canadian citizen and seven Jordanian security and police officers, at or near a tourist site in Karak, 130 km south of Amman. Two days later, in the same area, a shootout between a different terrorist group and Jordanian security forces occurred. Terrorist entities continue to express interest in attacking other &#8220;soft&#8221; targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls.</p><p>Travelers to Jordan should avoid the country's border with Syria and Iraq given the continued threat of cross-&#173;border attacks. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 km from the Jordan-&#173;Syria border, which includes the town of Ramtha. The 10 km area does not include the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must also have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border. U.S. government employees on personal travel are not permitted to visit the border areas or refugee camps, and the Embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid both locations. On occasion, the U.S. Embassy temporarily makes other areas within Jordan off limits to its staff based on the security situation.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Warnings</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Alerts</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/jordan.html">Country Specific Information for Jordan</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) Please provide your own current contact information and that for your emergency contact/next-of-kin.</li></ul><ul><li>Contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://jo.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/embassy/">U.S. Embassy in Amman</a>.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to the Republic of South Sudan because of ongoing fighting, intercommunal violence, and violent crime.<p>This replaces the Travel Warning dated January 4, 2017. &nbsp;</p><p>In July 2016, violent clashes between government and opposition forces broke out in Juba, resulting in the expulsion of opposition forces from the capital.&nbsp; Since then, armed conflict has expanded throughout the country, leading to continued instability that is exacerbated by intercommunal violence, cattle raiding, economic collapse, and an increase in violent crime. Aid workers, including U.S. citizens, have been the targets of shootings, ambushes, violent assaults, harassment, and robberies. All U.S. citizens in South Sudan should have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance, and should carry medical evacuation insurance.</p><p>The risk of violent crime is critical throughout South Sudan, including in Juba.&nbsp; Due to the risk of carjacking, crime, and unpredictable armed violence, travel outside of Juba should be undertaken with a minimum of two vehicles and appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/media/kicz_a0017_16_south_sudan.pdf">Notice to Airmen</a> (NOTAM).

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to consider the risks of travel to Egypt due to threats from terrorist and violent political opposition groups.<p>This replaces the Travel Warning issued on December 23, 2016. A number of terrorist groups, including ISIS, have committed multiple deadly attacks in Egypt, targeting government officials and security forces, public venues, tourist sites, civil aviation and other modes of public transportation, and a diplomatic facility. Terrorists continue to threaten Egypt&#8217;s religious minorities and have attacked sites and people associated with the Egyptian Coptic Church.</p><p>Terrorist attacks can occur anywhere in the country, including major metropolitan areas. In early May, ISIS media threatened that places associated with Westerners, Christians, the Egyptian military or police, and Egyptian government facilities could be struck at any time. The northeastern Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with frequent attacks on security forces and civilians. There are also reports of attacks on security forces in Egypt&#8217;s Western Desert, the large, mostly uninhabited area west of the Nile Valley, and in Egypt&#8217;s border areas. The Egyptian Military frequently conducts counterterrorism operations in these areas.</p><p>For security reasons, U.S. Mission personnel are prohibited from traveling to the Western Desert and the Sinai Peninsula. Overland travel is not allowed anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula, but U.S. Mission personnel are permitted to travel to and from Sharm El-Sheikh by air. Mission personnel are prohibited from visiting religious sites outside greater Cairo.</p><p>The Egyptian Government maintains a heavy security presence at major tourist sites in and around greater Cairo and Alexandria; at Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada, Marsa Alam and other beach resorts on the Red Sea and the Mediterranean coast; and at many of the major temples and archaeological sites located in and around the Nile Valley cities of Luxor and Aswan, including Abu Simbel.</p><p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Egypt, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For further background information regarding FAA flight advisories and prohibitions for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p><p>For further detailed information and assistance:</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a> for the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html">Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts</a>, and <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/egypt.html">Country Specific Information for Egypt</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy in Egypt.

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the city of Marawi, Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago including the southern Sulu Sea, and to exercise extreme caution when traveling to other regions of Mindanao, due to terrorist threats, insurgent activities, and kidnappings.<p>Similar threats also occurred throughout the Philippines in 2017. This replaces the Travel Warning dated December 20, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a threat of kidnappings-for-ransom of foreigners, including U.S. citizens, from terrorist and insurgent groups based in the Sulu Archipelago and in the southern Sulu Sea area. This area stretches from the southern tip of Palawan, along the coast of eastern Sabah, Malaysia and the islands of the Sulu Archipelago, up to Zamboanga City, Mindanao.&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy requires U.S. government personnel to obtain special authorization before traveling to Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.</p><p>Separatist and terrorist groups continue to attack and kidnap civilians, foreigners, political leaders, and Philippine security forces in Mindanao. On May 23, 2017, the Philippine government declared martial law throughout the Mindanao region.&nbsp; Review the following information:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In September 2016, a terrorist group detonated a bomb in Davao City, killing 14 and wounding at least 70 people. Following the attack, the Philippine government declared a &quot;State of National Emergency on Account of Lawless Violence in Mindanao.&quot;&nbsp;</li><li>In May 2017, an ongoing conflict erupted between terrorist groups and Philippine security forces in Marawi City, Mindanao, resulting in multiple dead and injured.</li><li>In central Mindanao, extremist groups aligned with the Islamic State, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, and other armed groups have carried out attacks on local government institutions, civilians, and security forces in the Cotabato City area, and in the Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat provinces, where the government maintains a state of emergency and a greater police presence.&nbsp;</li><li>In Mindanao, terrorists, insurgents, and criminal gangs regularly conduct kidnappings for ransom. Since January 2017, at least six separate kidnappings have been reported.</li><li>In western Mindanao, terrorists, insurgents, and criminal gangs regularly conduct kidnappings for ransom.&nbsp;</li><li>The U.S. Embassy has restricted U.S. government personnel travel to Mindanao.&nbsp;</li><li>There have been no reports of U.S. citizens in Mindanao targeted specifically for their nationality; however, general threats to U.S. citizens and other foreigners throughout Mindanao remain a concern.</li></ul><p>Recent terrorist threats, kidnappings, and bombings have occurred throughout the Philippines. U.S. Embassy Manila received credible information that terrorists planned to conduct kidnappings in Palawan, Cebu, and Bohol provinces in 2017. In November 2016, a terrorist group planted an Improvised Explosive Device near the U.S. Embassy in Metro Manila. In April and May 2017, bombings in Quiapo, Manila killed two and injured twenty.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a> for the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/philippines.html">Philippines Country Specific Information.</a></li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Philippines, located at 1201 Roxas Boulevard, at +(63) (2) 301-2000, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Mali due to ongoing terrorist attacks, criminal violence, and potential political instability.<p>U.S. citizens in Mali are reminded to stay vigilant, remain aware of their surroundings, and exercise caution, especially at night. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning dated December 23, 2016.</p><p>The potential for terrorist attacks in Bamako is high. Locations frequented by Westerners and other expatriates, including but not limited to night clubs, hotels, restaurants, places of worship, and Western diplomatic missions are targets for attacks. On June 18, 2017 terrorists attacked a hotel/resort complex 24 km east of Bamako city center, a site frequented primarily by Westerners and other expatriates. This was the fourth attack on such a site in the Bamako region since 2015.</p><p>On April 28, 2017 the Government of Mali extended the State of Emergency by six months. Roadblocks and random police checkpoints, especially between sundown and sun-up, are common in Bamako and throughout the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Northern and Central Mali are high risk areas for terrorist attacks, armed conflict, and armed robbery. U.S. government personnel in Mali are restricted from these regions except for travel deemed to be mission critical.</p><p>Violent extremist groups targeting foreigners have claimed responsibility for multiple terrorist attacks throughout Mali over the past 12 months. In March 2017, four Al-Qa&#8217;ida-linked groups merged under the name of Jama&#8217;at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM or &#8220;Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims&#8221;).&nbsp; Terrorist groups are likely to continue, if not escalate, attacks on United Nations and Western targets throughout the Sahel.&nbsp;</p><p>Westerners have been kidnapped for profit and/or ideological motives. Several Western hostages are believed to be captive in Mali, including a U.S. citizen who was kidnapped in Niger in October, 2016.</p><p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Mali, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/media/kicz_a0006_16_mali.pdf">Notice to Airmen</a><u> </u>(NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to Crimea and the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.  <p>This supersedes the Travel Warning for Ukraine dated December 14, 2016.</p><p>Russian-led separatists continue to control areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, where violent clashes have resulted in over 9,000 deaths.&nbsp; A ceasefire agreement established a de facto dividing line between Ukrainian government-controlled and non-government controlled areas of Ukraine, with a limited number of operational checkpoints controlled by government and Russian-led separatist forces. There have been multiple casualties due to land mines in areas previously controlled by the Russian-led separatists, and both sides of the contact line are mined.&nbsp; So-called &#8220;separatist leaders&#8221; have made statements indicating their desire to push the contact line to the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.&nbsp; Artillery and rocket attacks near the line of contact continue to occur regularly. Individuals, including U.S. citizens, have been threatened, detained, or kidnapped for hours or days after being stopped at separatist checkpoints, and one U.S. citizen working for OSCE&#8217;s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine was killed inside the non-government controlled area of Luhansk.&nbsp; The Government of Ukraine has stated that foreigners, including U.S. citizens, who enter Ukraine from Russia through non-government controlled territory, will not be allowed through checkpoints into government-controlled territory.&nbsp;</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prohibits U.S. civil aviation from flying in the Ukrainian Simferopol (UKFV) and Dnipropetrovsk (UKDV) Flight Information Regions.&nbsp; For further background information regarding FAA flight advisories and prohibitions for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p><p>The situation in Ukraine is unpredictable and could change quickly.&nbsp; U.S. citizens throughout Ukraine should avoid large crowds and be prepared to remain indoors should protests or demonstrations escalate.</p><p>U.S. Embassy Kyiv's Consular Section is open for all public services; however, in light of the ongoing unrest, the Embassy has severely restricted the travel of U.S. government personnel to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea, and occasionally limits travel to adjacent regions.&nbsp; As a result, the Embassy's ability to provide consular services, including responding to emergencies, to U.S. citizens in eastern Ukraine and Ukraine's Crimean region is extremely limited.</p><p>For further security information in Ukraine:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/ukraine.html">Ukraine Country Specific Information</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Ukraine</a>, located at 4 A.I Sikorsky Street (formerly Tankova) at +380-44-521-5566, or e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:KyivACS@state.gov">KyivACS@state.gov</a>&nbsp;8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p<i>.</i>m.

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against travel to remote areas of Algeria due to the threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping. <p>This replaces the Travel Warning for Algeria dated December 13, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>While violence has reduced significantly in recent years, terrorist groups remain active in some parts of the country. Although major cities are heavily policed, the possibility of terrorist acts in urban areas cannot be excluded. Extremists have conducted attacks in the following areas:</p><ul><li>mountainous region south and east of Algiers (provinces of Blida, Boumerdes, Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, and Bejaia)</li><li>further east outside the city of Constantine</li><li>southern and eastern border regions, including Tebessa and the Chaambi mountains area, south of Souk Ahras, near the Tunisian border&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Although most attacks are directed towards Algerian military or police, in September 2014, an ISIL-affiliated group abducted and killed a French citizen in the Kabylie region. In January 2013, an Al-Qaeda-linked organization attacked a gas production facility near In Amenas, Algeria, near the Libyan border, holding foreign and Algerian workers hostage, with dozens killed, including three U.S. citizens. &nbsp;</p><p>U.S. citizens should:</p><ul><li>avoid travel within 50 km (31 miles) of the eastern border and within 450 km (280 miles) of the southern border.</li><li>avoid overland travel across the Sahara. Travel to Saharan cities only by air.</li><li>remain on principal highways when traveling to coastal/mountainous areas east of Algiers and the mountains immediately south of Algiers.</li><li>always travel with reputable travel agents who know the area.</li><li>avoid staying overnight outside of the main cities and tourist locations.</li><li>inform local police when staying in locations outside of major cities.</li></ul><p>The Algerian government requires foreign diplomats and most foreign workers to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when traveling between wilayas (provinces) so that the government can evaluate the need for police coordination, to include escorts.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risk of travel to Colombia. <p>U.S. citizens should exercise caution, as violence linked to domestic insurgency, narco-trafficking, crime, and kidnapping occur in some rural and urban areas.&nbsp; This replaces the previous travel warning dated April 5, 2016. &nbsp;</p><p>Organized political and criminal armed groups are active throughout much of the country and their methods include the use of explosives and bomb threats in public spaces. Violence associated with the armed groups occurs in rural areas as well as Colombia's major cities, including in the capital. These groups are heavily involved in the drug trade, extortion, kidnapping, and robbery. On November 30, 2016, the Colombian government approved a peace accord with the largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The peace agreement is in the process of being implemented and does not include other active armed groups.</p><p>Violent crime is a threat throughout Colombia. Kidnapping remains a threat, although U.S. citizens are not specifically targeted. Violent political groups and other criminal organizations occasionally kidnap and hold civilians, including foreigners, for ransom.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. government officials and their families are generally permitted to travel to major cities only by air. They may not use inter- or intra-city bus transportation or travel by road outside urban areas at night. During daylight, they are permitted to use only the following routes:</p><ul><li>Main highways between Bogota and Bucaramanga, and between Bogota and Ibague.</li><li>Highways between Manizales, Pereira, and Armenia and within the &#8220;coffee country&#8221; departments of Caldas, Risaralda, and Quind&#237;o.</li><li>Highway 90 from Cartagena, through Barranquilla to Santa Marta.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>All other travel by U.S. government personnel and their families requires a security review and specific authorization.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do travel to Colombia, review your personal security plans, remain alert to your surroundings, and learn more about staying safe on our <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/colombia.html">Country Specific Information page for Colombia</a>.

<title>Iraq Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 16:46:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/iraq-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/iraq-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Iraq.<p>Travel within Iraq remains very dangerous, and the ability of the Embassy to assist U.S. citizens facing difficulty is extremely limited. This supersedes the Travel Warning dated January 31, 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS (also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, Islamic State and Iraq ash-Sham, or Da'esh). Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur frequently in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. U.S. citizens should pay particular attention to the possibility of terrorist attacks around religious and civic holidays.</p><p>Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators, magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and gunfire. Such attacks often take place in public places, including cafes and markets. Facilities of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), the U.S. government, and western interests remain possible targets.</p><p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to or transiting through Iraq, or entering Syria, to engage in armed conflict. In addition to the extreme personal risks of kidnapping, injury, or death posed by such actions, legal risks include arrest, fines, and expulsion. Since the closure of the border between Syria and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR), the KRG has stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the border. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS, can constitute providing material support for terrorism, a crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines in the United States.</p><p>The Embassy urges U.S. citizens in Iraq to avoid protests and large gatherings. Iraqi authorities have responded forcefully when violence has occurred, including on two occasions in 2016 when protestors entered the International Zone (IZ) in Baghdad and attacked Iraqi government buildings. These incursions resulted in personal injury to both protesters and security personnel. Demonstrations in Baghdad have also occurred in and around Tahrir Square. Demonstrations in Basrah have occurred at the offices of the Provincial Council and governor.</p><p>The Department of State strongly cautions U.S. citizens not to travel near the Syrian, Turkish, or Iranian borders with Iraq, which are especially dangerous and not always clearly defined. U.S. citizens traveling near border areas may encounter aerial or artillery bombardments, unmarked minefields, border skirmishes with smugglers, and large refugee flows. Neighboring governments, including Iran, have detained U.S. citizens who approach these borders.</p><p>The Government of Iraq strictly enforces regulations regarding visas and entry, authorizations for weapons, and movements through checkpoints. U.S. citizens traveling to Iraq without the proper authorization or whose purpose of travel is not readily apparent have been detained without warning. For more information on entry/exit requirements, please see our <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/iraq.html">Country Specific Information page for Iraq</a>.</p><p>The Government of Iraq has begun to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam. However, a dam failure could cause significant flooding, loss of life, and interruption of essential services from Mosul to Baghdad. While it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood of the dam&#8217;s failing, the Embassy has made contingency plans to relocate its personnel in such an event. The Embassy recommends that U.S. citizens in Iraq who reside in the floodplain of the Tigris River prepare their own contingency plans, have valid U.S. passports, and stay informed of local media reports and Embassy security messages.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. All U.S. government employees under the authority of the U.S. Chief of Mission must follow strict safety and security procedures when traveling outside the Embassy and Consulates. The internal security policies of the U.S. Mission in Iraq may change at any time. The Mission will regularly restrict or prohibit movements by its personnel, often on short notice, for security threats or demonstrations.</p><p>U.S. citizens who come to Iraq despite this warning should have medical insurance that provides coverage in Iraq, as well as supplemental medevac insurance to provide medical transport out of the country. The U.S. government does not pay medical bills or medical transport fees for U.S. citizens. Medicare and Medicaid do not cover medical costs outside the United States. Travelers should expect no medical assistance from the U.S. government.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that U.S. civil aviation flying in Iraqi airspace is at risk from ongoing combat operations involving military forces (military aerial combat operations and other militarily-related activity) and militant groups. As a result, the FAA currently prohibits U.S. civil aviation from operating in or overflying Iraqi airspace with very limited exceptions. Foreign airlines operating in Iraq may cancel their operations without warning due to the security environment or other factors. Travelers should remain vigilant and reconfirm all flight schedules with their airline prior to commencing any travel.&nbsp; For further background information regarding FAA prohibitions on U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices website.</a></p><p>For more information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/iraq.html">&nbsp;Specific Information for Iraq.</a></li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://iq.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Iraq</a>, located in the International Zone, Baghdad, via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Baghdadacs@state.gov">email</a>, or by accessing&nbsp;<a href="https://iq.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/">U.S. Embassy Baghdad&#8217;s website.</a>&nbsp;The after-hours emergency numbers are 011-964-770-443-1286 or 011-964-770-030-4888 (from the United States) or 0770-443-1286 or 0770-030-4888 (within Iraq).&nbsp;</li><li>As cell phone service is unreliable in Iraq, emergency calls may also be placed through the Department of State at 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries.</li><li>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/travelgov">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/travelgov">Facebook</a>.</li></ul>]]></description>

<title>Burkina Faso Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:06:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/burkina-faso-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/burkina-faso-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Burkina Faso, and recommends they avoid travel to the northern part of the Sahel region, and exercise caution in the rest of Burkina Faso, due to continuing threats to safety and security, including terrorism.<p>The ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services in remote and rural areas of the country is limited.&nbsp;This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning issued on January 20, 2016.</p><p>The security environment in Burkina Faso is fluid and attacks are possible anywhere in the country, including Ouagadougou. ISIS, al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and al-Murabitun terrorist organizations and affiliates have declared their intention to attack foreign targets in North and West Africa. In January 2016, armed assailants attacked civilians at the Splendid Hotel and Cappuccino restaurant in Ouagadougou, killing 30 people, including one U.S. citizen. AQIM and al-Murabitun claimed responsibility for the attack.&nbsp;Violent extremist groups increased their activities in Burkina Faso&#8217;s Sahel region in 2016 and 2017, attacking police stations, customs offices, military posts, and schools in Koutougou, Intangom, Markoye, Tinakoff, Nassoumbou, Kourfayel, and Baraboule.</p><p>In the border regions shared by Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, extremist groups and linked criminal networks have targeted Westerners for kidnapping. These northern regions are extremely remote, and the ability of the governments of either Burkina Faso or the United States to provide emergency assistance there is very limited.</p><p>Due to the risk of attacks throughout the Sahel region, the U.S. Embassy has placed restrictions on official government travel to Dori and Djibo, the road that connects these cities, and all areas north of that road. Embassy personnel traveling to or staying at Parc National du W (Parc W), the regional national park located on Burkina Faso&#8217;s southeastern border with Niger and Benin, must arrange armed escort with Burkina Faso security forces.&nbsp;U.S. citizens are encouraged to follow the same guidance.</p><p>U.S. citizens who choose to visit or remain in Burkina Faso should maintain situational awareness at all times, and have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Take steps to mitigate the risk of becoming a victim of violence, including limiting trips to locations frequented by Westerners.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a> for the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/burkina-faso.html"><i>&nbsp;Country Specific Information for Burkina Faso</i></a><i>.</i></li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the <a href="https://bf.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou</a>, in Ouaga 2000, Sector 15, on Avenue Sembene Ousmane, southeast of the Monument aux H&#233;ros Nationaux, at (+226) 25-49-53-00, 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Friday.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of ongoing tensions and potential terrorist activity throughout Chad. <p>U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to the border regions, particularly the Lake Chad region, and exercise extreme caution elsewhere in the country. U.S. Embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of N&#8217;Djamena as well as outside of the capital, including the Lake Chad Basin. The U.S. Embassy&#8217;s ability to provide consular services outside of N&#8217;Djamena is limited. This replaces the Travel Warning issued on November 4, 2016.</p><p>Violent extremist organizations in the region, such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State of Iraq and Ash-Sham &#8211;West Africa (ISIS-WA), can easily cross borders and target foreigners, local security forces, and civilians. In May 2017, Boko Haram attacked a Chadian military base in the Lake Chad region. A radicalized Chadian fired shots outside the U.S. Embassy building in November 2016. Kidnapping for ransom is common - in March 2017 a French citizen was abducted in eastern Chad and held for more than six weeks. There are also minefields along the Libyan and Sudanese borders.&nbsp;</p><p>Exercise extreme caution throughout the country due to the threat of indiscriminate crime. U.S. citizens should be vigilant at public gatherings and any locations frequented by foreigners, including markets, hotels, restaurants, bars, and places of worship. Maintain situational awareness and avoid crowds, as even peaceful gatherings can turn violent unexpectedly. Border crossings may close without notice.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. citizens affiliated with humanitarian relief efforts should develop an evacuation plan with the United Nations agency coordinating their work. All U.S. citizens should have evacuation plans that do not rely solely on U.S. government assistance.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/chad.html">Country Specific Information for Chad</a> and <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a> .</li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>).

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of traveling to Haiti due to its current security environment and lack of adequate medical facilities and response, especially in the areas of Petionville and the storm-damaged southern peninsula departments of Grand Anse and Sud. <p>This replaces the Travel Warning dated November 4, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Rates of kidnapping, murder, and rape rose in 2016. While there is no indication that U. S. citizens are specifically targeted, kidnapping for ransom can affect anyone in Haiti, particularly long-term residents. Armed robberies and violent assaults reported by U.S. citizens have risen in recent years. Do not share specific travel plans with strangers. Be aware that newly arrived travelers are targeted. Arrange to have your host or organization meet you at the airport upon arrival or pre-arranged airport to hotel transfers. Be cautious when visiting banks and ATMs, which are often targeted by criminals. Fewer incidents of crime are reported outside of Port-au-Prince, but Haitian authorities' ability to respond to emergencies is limited and in some areas nonexistent. U.S. Embassy employees are discouraged from walking in city neighborhoods, including in Petionville. Visit only establishments with secured parking lots. U.S. Embassy personnel are under a curfew from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. Embassy personnel must receive permission from the Embassy security officer to travel to some areas of Port-au-Prince and some regions of the country, thus limiting the Embassy&#8217;s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>Protests, including tire burning and road blockages are frequent and often spontaneous. Avoid all demonstrations. The Haitian National Police&#8217;s ability to assist U.S. citizens during disturbances is limited. Have your own plans for quickly exiting the country if necessary.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy remains concerned about the security situation in the southern peninsula departments of Grand Anse and Sud following the devastation of Hurricane Matthew. Embassy employees are not permitted to travel to those departments without special approval for and official trips only.&nbsp;</p><p>Medical care infrastructure, ambulances, and other emergency services are limited throughout Haiti.&nbsp;Check that your organization has reliable infrastructure, evacuation, and medical support in place.

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all non-essential travel to Pakistan.<p>This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning dated April 12, 2017.</p><p>Consular services provided by the American Embassy in Islamabad, the Consulate General in Karachi, and the Consulate General in Lahore are often limited due to the security environment. At this time, the Consulate General in Peshawar is not providing consular services.</p><p>Pakistan continues to experience significant terrorist violence, including sectarian attacks. Targeted attacks against government officials, humanitarian and non-governmental organization (NGO) employees, tribal elders, and law enforcement personnel are common. Throughout Pakistan, foreign and indigenous terrorist groups continue to pose a danger to U.S. citizens. Evidence suggests that some victims of terrorist activity have been targeted because they are U.S. citizens. Terrorists and criminal groups have resorted to kidnapping for ransom.</p><p>The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, following attacks or in response to threats.</p><p>Terrorists continue to target:</p><ul><li>Heavily guarded facilities, such as military and government installations and airports</li><li>Universities, schools, and hospitals</li><li>Places of worship of various faiths</li><li>Rallies, public parks, and sports venues</li><li>Hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants</li></ul><p>In 2017, an improvised explosive device placed in a marketplace in Kurram Valley in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) killed at least 25 people and injured at least 87 others; in Lahore, in an attack that militants said was directed at senior police officials, a suicide bomber detonated himself outside the Punjab Assembly killing at least 14 people and injuring at least 87; in Sindh province, a suicide bomber detonated himself in the Sufi Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, killing at least 88 people and injuring over 350; in Parachinar in the FATA, a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device detonated outside a Shia congregation, killing at least 25 people and injuring at least 90; and in Balochistan, a suicide bomber detonated himself on the N-25 National Highway, reportedly targeting a senior politician&#8217;s convoy, killing at least 28 people and injuring at least 40 others.</p><p>Sectarian violence remains a serious threat throughout Pakistan, and the Government of Pakistan continues to enforce blasphemy laws. Religious minority communities have been victims of targeted killings and accusations of blasphemy.</p><p>The local government restricts access for foreigners to many areas, including:</p><ul><li>the FATA along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border,</li><li>Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,</li><li>the area adjacent to the Line of Control in the disputed territory of Kashmir,</li><li>much of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and Balochistan.</li></ul><p>Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted and movements by U.S. government personnel outside of Islamabad are severely restricted. U.S. government personnel may not:</p><ul><li>Attend services at places of worship without prior approval.</li><li>Use public transportation or stay overnight at hotels in Pakistan.</li></ul><p>If you choose to live or travel in Pakistan despite this warning, you should:</p><ul><li>Vary travel routes and timing, especially for routine trips.</li><li>Minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, government and military institutions, and other locations.</li><li>Minimize the number of U.S./western nationals congregating in any one location at any time.</li><li>Avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures.</li><li>Take a photo of your passport, entry stamp and Pakistani visa, and keep it with you at all times.

<title>Yemen Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 16:24:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/yemen-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/yemen-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Yemen because of the high security threat level posed by ongoing conflict and terrorist activities.<p>The Department of State updated this Travel Warning in October 2016 to reflect concerns regarding detentions of U.S. citizens by armed groups in Sanaa, and this threat remains unchanged. The Department continues to urge U.S. citizens to defer all travel to Yemen. We urge U.S. citizens currently living in Yemen to depart as soon as they are able to safely do so. This supersedes the Travel Warning for Yemen issued on October 6, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since the beginning of the conflict in March 2015, rebel groups in Sanaa have systematically detained U.S. citizens.&nbsp; Reports indicate that U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, are being targeted by virtue of their citizenship, regardless of the amount of time they have spent in Yemen, their established connections with the rebel groups, or their connections with local businesses or humanitarian organizations aimed at providing relief to those in need.&nbsp; During their detentions, which in some cases have lasted over a year, U.S. citizens have not been able to contact their families or be visited by U.S. consular personnel or international humanitarian organizations. The U.S. government&#8217;s ability to assist U.S. citizens in detention is severely limited. There is no U.S. government presence on the ground following the rebel takeover of Sanaa. The Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff relocated out of the country in February 2015.&nbsp;All consular services, routine and/or emergency, are suspended until further notice.</p><p>In addition to the threat of detention by rebel groups, there are other risks due to ongoing conflict and heightened terrorist activity, including kidnappings for ransom. &nbsp;In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition initiated an air campaign in support of the exiled Yemeni government. A nationwide cessation of hostilities deteriorated in August 2016, and high levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, now persist in areas throughout the country. There are also reports of land mines being placed in areas vacated by withdrawing forces, as well as mining of Red Sea ports. Military conflict has caused significant damage to infrastructure, limiting the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care. This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water.</p><p>In addition, the threat posed by violent extremist groups in Yemen remains high. Al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) expanded its influence in Yemen since the beginning of the conflict.&nbsp;Because of the instability and violence in Yemen, the internationally recognized government cannot effectively enforce counterterrorism measures and a large security vacuum persists. AQAP, in particular, has benefitted from the conflict by significantly expanding its presence in the southern and eastern governorates.&nbsp; ISIL also has established a presence in Yemen, and has claimed responsibility for a number of deadly attacks in the country. AQAP and ISIL-Y terrorists carried out hundreds of attacks throughout Yemen in 2016. Methods included suicide bombers, VBIEDs, ambushes, kidnappings, and targeted assassinations. The U.S. government remains extremely concerned about possible attacks on U.S. citizens (whether visiting or residing in Yemen), and U.S. facilities, businesses, and perceived U.S. and Western interests.</p><p>Vessels in the region of the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden should operate under a heightened state of alert as increasing tensions in the region escalate the potential for direct or collateral damage to vessels transiting the region. These threats may come from a variety of different sources such as missiles, projectiles, or waterborne improvised explosive devices. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for an October 1, 2016, attack on a UAE vessel, and missiles were fired at the USS Mason from Houthi-held territory that same month. A <a href="https://www.marad.dot.gov/msci/advisory/2017/2017-002-regional-conflict-and-terrorism-bab-al-mandeb-gulf-of-aden-and-red-sea/">maritime advisory</a> is currently in effect for Yemen as a result of regional tensions.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marad.dot.gov/msci/advisory/2017/23695/">Piracy</a> is also a concern in the area.</p><p>The United States is also concerned about the risks to civil&nbsp;aviation operating in specified areas of the Sanaa (OYSC) Flight Information Region (FIR) due to the ongoing military operations, political instability, and violence from competing armed groups involved in combat operations and other military-related activity. The&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has prohibited U.S. civil aviation&nbsp;from flying in specific areas within the Sanaa FIR. For additional background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult&nbsp;<a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For U.S. citizen inquiries, you may send an email to <a href="mailto:YEMENEMERGENCYUSC@state.gov">YEMENEMERGENCYUSC@state.gov</a>.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a> <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html">Travel Warnings</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html">Travel Alerts</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/yemen.html">&nbsp;Specific Information for Yemen.</a></li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/" title="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.

<title>Israel, The West Bank and Gaza Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 16:27:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/israel-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/israel-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to the Gaza Strip and urges those present to depart.<p>The security situation remains complex in Israel and the West Bank and can change quickly depending on the political environment, recent events, and particular geographic location. U.S. citizens should exercise caution and remain aware of their surroundings when traveling to areas where there are heightened tensions and security risks. The Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority both make considerable efforts to ensure security, particularly in areas where foreigners frequently travel. This replaces the Travel Warning issued August 23, 2016. &nbsp;</p><p>Gaza is under the control of Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization. The security environment within Gaza and on its borders is dangerous and volatile.&nbsp; Violent demonstrations and shootings occur on a frequent basis and the collateral risks are high. While Israel and Hamas continue to observe the temporary cease-fire that ended the latest Gaza conflict in 2014, sporadic mortar or rocket fire and corresponding Israeli military responses continue to occur.</p><p>Within Israel and the West Bank, the possibility of random violence continues to exist and can happen without warning. The frequency of attacks has declined significantly since a rise in political and religious tensions led to a spike in violence in October 2015. U.S. citizens have been killed and wounded in recent attacks, though there is no indication they were specifically targeted based on nationality. Perceived religious affiliation was a factor in some of the attacks, and the majority of recent attacks have targeted uniformed Israeli security forces often in proximity to checkpoints throughout Jerusalem and the West Bank or near religious sites significant to multiple faiths. Attacks were carried out using knives, vehicles, and guns. Israeli security forces reacted with deadly force, which has resulted in some bystanders being injured or killed in the crossfire. U.S. citizens should stay abreast of current events in order to know what areas to avoid when traveling throughout the region.</p><p>For your safety, the Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens:</p><ul><li>Avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip, and if you are there, leave as soon as you are able;</li><li>Maintain a high degree of situational awareness and exercise caution at all times, especially at checkpoints and other areas with a significant presence of security forces;</li><li>Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings &#8211; which can turn violent &#8211; and steer clear of neighborhoods where police have restricted access;</li><li>Beware of and report unattended items or packages;</li><li>Follow the instructions of security and emergency officials;</li><li>Report suspicious activities or items to security officials; and</li><li>Learn the location of the nearest bomb shelter or other hardened shelter.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>When planning their own travel, U.S. citizens should consider the following rules that apply to U.S. government employee travel:</p><ul><li>U.S. government employees are not allowed to travel to Gaza;</li><li>With the exception of Jericho, Bethlehem, and along Routes 1, 443, and 90, U.S. government employees are prohibited from personal travel within the West Bank.&nbsp; Restrictions on personal travel by U.S. government employees may change depending on the security environment;</li><li>All other U.S. government travel into the West Bank outside the aforementioned areas must be for official business and conducted with enhanced security measures;&nbsp;</li><li>U.S. government staff take additional security precautions when visiting refugee camps, West Bank universities, and &#8220;seam areas&#8221; where Israelis and Palestinians are in proximity to each other, and which have historically been flashpoints for violence.&nbsp; For example, sites with significant religious meaning to multiple faiths can be subject to violent protests or security incidents with little or no warning, especially during or around significant religious holidays;</li><li>U.S. government employees are prohibited from personal travel into Jerusalem&#8217;s Old City on Fridays during the Muslim month of Ramadan.&nbsp; The U.S. government occasionally restricts travel for its employees to the Old City based on the current security environment;</li><li>U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses and public bus terminals throughout Israel and the West Bank; and</li><li>U.S. government employees must observe additional security requirements&nbsp; if traveling for any reason to the following locations:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 80px;">o&nbsp;&nbsp; within 7 miles of the Gaza demarcation line;</p><p style="margin-left: 80px;">o&nbsp;&nbsp; within 1.5 miles of the Lebanon border;&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 80px;">o&nbsp;&nbsp; on or east of Route 98 in the Golan; and</p><p style="margin-left: 80px;">o&nbsp;&nbsp; within 1.5 miles of the Egypt border along the Sinai (including all portions of Route 10 and portions of Route 12).</p><p>U.S. citizens planning to travel to Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza should consult the detailed information concerning entry and exit difficulties in the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/israel.html">Country Specific Information</a>&nbsp;(CSI).

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Niger due to terrorist activity, kidnappings and high crime.<p>The Department recommends U.S. citizens avoid travel to Niger&#8217;s border regions, particularly the Malian border area, Diffa region and Lake Chad Basin area because of activity by extremist groups including al-Qa&#8217;eda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham &#8211; Islamic State West Africa, and Boko Haram. Due to security concerns and travel restrictions, the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s ability to assist U.S. citizens in remote and rural areas is very limited. This replaces the Travel Warning dated January 21, 2016.</p><p>Terrorist organizations, armed robbers and smugglers operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, and throughout northern Niger. Mali-based extremist groups have crossed the border and carried out multiple lethal attacks on Nigerien security forces.</p><p>The government of Niger has maintained a state of emergency in the Diffa region since February 10, 2015, and a curfew has been in place in the Diffa region since December 2014. The Nigerien government declared a state of emergency on March 3, 2017 for seven departments of the Tillaberi and Tahoua regions bordering Mali after a spate of deadly attacks.</p><p>There is significant potential for violent crime outside Niamey, and armed robbers target travelers throughout the country. Outside the city of Niamey, all U.S. Embassy personnel are required to travel only during daylight hours in a minimum two-vehicle convoy accompanied by armed Nigerien government security escorts.</p><p>There is a high threat of kidnapping by terrorist groups including AQIM, which has kidnapped Westerners and threatened U.S. citizens in Niger. As a result of safety and security concerns some organizations, including foreign companies, NGOs and private aid organizations, have suspended operations in Niger or withdrawn family members and/or staff.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a> for the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/niger.html"><i>&nbsp;Country Specific Information for Niger</i></a><i>.</i></li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the <a href="https://ne.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Niger</a>, located at 11201 Rue des Ambassades in Niamey, at +(227) 20-72-26-61, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Friday.

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Nigeria and recommends that U.S. citizens avoid all but essential travel to Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kano, and Yobe states because the security situation in northeast Nigeria remains fluid and unpredictable.  <p>Very poor transportation infrastructure also makes it difficult for the U.S. Mission to provide consular services in these states. All U.S. citizens should have evacuation plans that do not solely rely on U.S. government assistance. Due to the risk of kidnappings, robberies, and other armed attacks, U.S. citizens should also avoid all but essential travel to: Bayelsa, Delta, Jigawa, Kaduna, Katsina, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, and Zamfara states. This replaces the Travel Warning dated February 8, 2017.</p><p>Boko Haram, an extremist group based in the northeast, has targeted churches, schools, mosques, government installations, educational institutions, and entertainment venues in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Taraba, the Federal Capital Territory, and Yobe states. Hundreds of thousands of Nigerians have been displaced as a result of violence in the north. Islamic State West Africa, which is now a distinct group from Boko Haram, is present in Nigeria, and may seek to attack locations frequented by westerners including major population centers.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. citizens should be vigilant at public gatherings and locations frequented by foreigners. Markets, hotels, restaurants, bars, and places of worship may become targets for terrorist attacks. Exercise extreme caution throughout the country due to the threat of indiscriminate violence.&nbsp;</p><p>Travel to the Gulf of Guinea should also be avoided because of the threat of piracy.</p><p>U.S. Mission personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in Nigeria, with the exception of local areas of Abuja and Lagos, and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>,<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/nigeria.html">Nigeria Country-Specific Information</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, located at Plot 1075 Diplomatic Drive, Central District Area, open Monday-Thursday, 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The U.S. Consulate General in Lagos, located at 2 Walter Carrington Crescent, Victoria Island, is open Monday-Thursday from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The U.S. Embassy in Abuja can be reached by telephone, including after-hours emergencies, at +234 (9) 461-4176 or +234 (9) 461-4000, or by email at AbujaACS@state.gov.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Sudan.<p>U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to the Darfur region, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan states and consider carefully before planning travel to other areas of Sudan due to the risks of terrorism, armed conflict and violent crime. The U.S. Embassy's ability to provide services outside of Khartoum is extremely limited. This replaces the Travel Warning issued on January 21, 2016.</p><p>Terrorist groups are active in Sudan and have stated their intent to harm Westerners and Western interests through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. Violent crimes targeting Westerners, including kidnappings, armed robberies, home invasions, and carjacking occur everywhere in Sudan but are particularly prevalent in the Darfur region.</p><p>U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Sudan despite this warning should be vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times, especially when at public gatherings and any location frequented by foreigners. Exercise extreme caution, monitor reliable news sources for information on the local security situation, and follow the instructions of local authorities. All U.S. citizens in Sudan should periodically assess their personal security and have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.</p><p>Despite numerous cease fires declared by the Government of Sudan and opposition forces, tensions in the Darfur region, along the border between Chad and Sudan, and in areas that border South Sudan, including the disputed area of Abyei&#8206; remain high and violence continues. In addition to risking injury or death, U.S. citizens who go to these areas without the permission of the Sudanese government may be detained by security forces.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy requires U.S. government personnel in Sudan to use armored vehicles for all travel, and prohibits travel outside of Khartoum without advance permission and extra security precautions.&nbsp; Family members of U.S. government employees assigned to Sudan must be at least 21 years old in order to live there.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a> for the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/sudan.html">Country Specific Information for Sudan</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact the <a href="https://sudan.usembassy.gov/index.html">U.S. Embassy in Sudan</a> located at P.O.

<description><![CDATA[The State Department warns U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to Saudi Arabia due to continuing threats from terrorist groups.<p>Furthermore, violence in Yemen has spilled over into Saudi Arabia on a number of occasions. This warning supersedes the Travel Warning issued July 27, 2016.</p><p>Threat of Terrorism &#8211; Terrorist groups, including ISIS and its affiliates, have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and significant religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.</p><p>Saudi authorities have announced that 34 terrorist attacks, some resulting in significant loss of life, occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2016.

<description><![CDATA[U.S. citizens are warned of increased threats from terrorist groups in Turkey.<p>Carefully consider the need to travel to Turkey at this time, and avoid travel to southeast Turkey due to the persistent threat of terrorism.&nbsp; On March 27, the Department of State terminated its October 29, 2016, decision to direct family members of employees posted to the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul to depart Turkey temporarily.&nbsp; However, there are restrictions on personal and official travel by U.S. government personnel and their family members traveling to and residing in Istanbul.&nbsp; Restrictions on travel by U.S. government personnel to certain areas in southeast Turkey, including Adana, remain. &nbsp;This replaces the travel warning dated January 25, 2017.</p><p>In 2016, numerous terrorist attacks involving shootings, suicide bombings, and vehicle-borne bombings in tourist areas, public spaces, private celebrations, sporting events, and government, police, and military facilities throughout Turkey resulted in hundreds of deaths.&nbsp; The most recent attacks include a mass shooting at the Istanbul Reina nightclub on January 1, 2017, and simultaneous suicide bombings near Istanbul&#8217;s Besiktas/Vodafone Soccer Stadium on December 10, 2016.&nbsp; In addition, an increase in anti-American rhetoric has the potential to inspire independent actors to carry out acts of violence against U.S. citizens.</p><p>Additional attacks in Turkey could occur at major events, tourist sites, restaurants, nightclubs, commercial centers, places of worship, and transportation hubs, including aviation services, metros, buses, bridges, bus terminals, and sea transport.&nbsp; Foreign and U.S. tourists and expatriates have been explicitly targeted by terrorist organizations in Turkey for kidnapping and assassination.&nbsp; We remind U.S. citizens to review their personal security plans including communications preparedness/connectivity, monitor local news for breaking events, remain vigilant at all times, and check in with loved ones after an attack or security incident.&nbsp;</p><p>On January 4, the Turkish government extended the state of emergency through April 18, 2017.&nbsp; The Turkish government will decide in April whether to extend the state of emergency for another 90 days. &nbsp;Under the state of emergency, security forces have expanded powers and the government has, at times, restricted internet access and media content.&nbsp; U.S. citizens have been deported and/or detained and held without access to lawyers or family members under the state of emergency.&nbsp; Delays or denial of consular access to U.S. citizens detained or arrested by security forces, some of whom also possess Turkish citizenship, have become more common.&nbsp; U.S. citizen employees of some non-governmental organizations in Turkey have also recently experienced increased scrutiny and denials related to residence permit applications.&nbsp; The Department continues to monitor the security environment for potential impact on the safety and well-being of U.S. citizens in Turkey and urges U.S. citizens to register in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> on www.travel.state.gov to stay informed.</p><p>U.S. government personnel and their family members residing in or visiting Istanbul are restricted from congregating or traveling in large groups and are not permitted to visit these Istanbul locations without prior approval from the Consulate:</p><ul><li>Large, crowded areas such as shopping malls and houses of worship frequented by expatriates, entertainment complexes, nightclubs, public sporting/cultural performance venues, and crowded pedestrian thoroughfares</li><li>Tourist destinations throughout Istanbul, to include historical sites, monuments, large bazaar markets, and museums.</li></ul><p>U.S. government personnel living in or visiting Turkey continue to require approval from the U.S. Embassy&nbsp; to visit the&nbsp; southeastern provinces of Hatay, Kilis, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, Sirnak, Diyarbakir, Van, Siirt, Mus, Mardin, Batman, Bingol, Tunceli, Hakkari, Bitlis, and Elazig.&nbsp; Travel within Adana by U.S. government personnel may also be subject to restriction.&nbsp; Furthermore, the U.S. Embassy may prohibit movements by its personnel and those of its subordinate Consulates to these areas on short notice for security reasons.&nbsp; Due to recent acts of violence and the potential for reprisal attacks by terrorist groups due to continued Turkish military activity in Syria, we urge U.S. citizens to defer travel to large urban centers near the Turkish/Syrian border.&nbsp; U.S. citizens should also be aware that the Government of Turkey has closed its border with Syria.&nbsp; The Government of Turkey prohibits border crossings from Syria into Turkey, even if the traveler entered Syria from Turkey.&nbsp; Turkish authorities will consider permitting the passage of individuals seeking emergency medical treatment or safety from immediate danger on a case by case basis.</p><p>On March 21, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/03/21/qa-aviation-security-enhancements-select-last-point-departure-airports-commercial">announced</a> enhanced security measures associated with passengers at certain last-point-of-departure airports to the United States in several countries, including Istanbul&#8217;s Ataturk International Airport. &nbsp;The security enhancements require all personal electronic devices larger than a smart phone be placed in checked baggage.&nbsp; Approved medical devices may be brought into the cabin after additional screening.&nbsp; For questions about these regulations, please contact your air carrier and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/03/21/qa-aviation-security-enhancements-select-last-point-departure-airports-commercial">the Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p><p>Numerous large gatherings and rallies, many of a political nature, are expected to be held throughout Turkey in late March and April 2017.&nbsp; U.S. Mission Turkey recommends that U.S. citizens avoid all gatherings, protests, or demonstrations in Turkey, regardless of their purpose, due to the potential for violence or personal injury.&nbsp; Under the current state of emergency, participation in illegal gatherings, protests, and/or demonstrations can result in detention or arrest.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to far eastern Mauritania due to the activities of terrorist groups which are active in the neighboring regions of Mali including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and those which pose a threat in the greater Sub-Saharan region, such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS).<p>The U.S. Embassy in Nouakchott is able to provide only very limited consular services in remote and rural areas of Mauritania. &nbsp;This replaces the Travel Warning for Mauritania dated February 23, 2016, to update U.S. citizens on the current security situation.</p><p>The government of Mauritania has designated the following areas as a restricted Security Zone, and you must have permission from Mauritanian authorities to travel there:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The eastern half of the Tagant region (east of Tidjikja)</li><li>The eastern half of the Adrar region (east of Ouadane)</li><li>The Zemmour region (other than F&#8217;Derick and Zouerat)</li></ul><p>Additionally, there is a risk of kidnapping and other violent crime in the Hodh El Charghi region near the southern and eastern border with Mali. Aside from the security risks, these areas are dangerous due to their remoteness and harsh environment. &nbsp;</p><p>ISIS, AQIM and al-Murabitun terrorist organizations and affiliates have declared their intention to attack foreign targets in North and West Africa (particularly the Sahel region south of the Sahara). &nbsp;In recent years, AQIM has kidnapped and murdered private citizens and attacked foreign diplomatic and gendarme military installations in Mauritania. &nbsp;Christian faith-based organizations operating in Mauritania, or individuals perceived to be proselytizing, may be targeted.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling outside Nouakchott unless specifically authorized to do so, and then only during daylight hours.&nbsp; Due to an increase in criminal activity, the Embassy has directed its official staff not to walk to or from work; to avoid walking whenever possible; and not to walk alone. Consider these restrictions and review your personal security plans periodically if you are in Mauritania or planning to go there.&nbsp;</p><p>For further information: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>See the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">State Department's travel website</a> for the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and Mauritania Country Specific Information.</li><li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy in Mauritania&nbsp;located between the Presidency and the Spanish Embassy, at + 222 4525-2660, 4525-1145, or 4525-3038, 8:00a.m &#8211; 5:00p.m. Monday &#8211; Thursday, and 8:00am &#8211; 12:00pm on Friday.

<title>Syria Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2017 16:32:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/syria-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/syria-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against all travel to Syria and strongly recommends that U.S. citizens remaining in Syria depart immediately.<p>The security situation remains dangerous and unpredictable. Violent conflict between government and armed anti-government groups continues throughout the country. There is a serious risk for kidnappings, bombings, murder, and terrorism. This replaces the Travel Warning dated October 11, 2016.</p><p>No part of Syria is safe from violence. Kidnappings, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment have significantly raised the risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p><p>Terrorist and other violent extremist groups including ISIS and al-Qa&#8217;ida&#8217;s Syrian affiliateal-Nusrah Front (also known as Jabhat al-Nusrah, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, and other aliases), operate in Syria. Tactics for these groups include the use of suicide bombers, kidnapping, small and heavy arms, and improvised explosive devices. They have targeted major city centers, road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, shopping areas, and open spaces, including in Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, and Dayr al-Zawr provinces. These groups have murdered and kidnapped U.S. citizens, both for ransom and political purposes. U.S. citizens have disappeared within Syria. Public places, such as road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, shopping areas, and open spaces, have been targeted. Because of the security situation in Syria, the U.S. government&#8217;s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited. Although a ceasefire was announced in December 2016, fighting persists in Syria. Moreover, the ceasefire does not include ISIS or al-Nusrah Front, which have not renounced the use of violence. The ceasefire does not make the security situation in Syria any less dangerous for U.S. citizens.</p><p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity, and our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited. Individuals who demonstrate an interest in groups opposing ISIS, including on social media, could open themselves to being targeted by ISIS itself if those individuals travel to Syria.</p><p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Nusrah Front, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p><p>Communications in Syria are difficult as phone and internet connections are unreliable. U.S. citizens have reported facing dangers traveling within the country and when trying to leave Syria via land borders, given the diminishing availability of commercial air travel out of Syria. Fierce clashes between pro-government and opposition forces continue in the vicinity of the Damascus and Aleppo airports. &nbsp;Opposition-held land border checkpoints should not be considered safe, as they are targeted by regime attacks and some armed groups have sought funding through kidnappings for ransom. Border areas are frequent targets of shelling and other attacks and are crowded because of internally-displaced refugees. Errant attacks will occasionally hit border towns just outside the borders as well. Road checkpoints have been controlled by armed terrorist and violent extremist groups and have been utilized to conduct kidnappings, including of U.S. citizens.</p><p>The&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prohibits U.S. civil aviation&nbsp;from flying in the Damascus Flight Information Region (FIR) because of the ongoing armed conflict and volatile security environment. This FIR includes all the airspace over Syria and extends into adjacent international airspace. In addition, U.S. government personnel in Lebanon are prohibited from taking flights that pass through the Damascus FIR. A number of armed extremist groups are known to be equipped with a variety of antiaircraft weapons that have the capability to threaten civil aircraft. For additional background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult <a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p><p><br>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012 and cannot provide protection or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria. The Government of the Czech Republic, acting through its Embassy in Damascus, serves as Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria. The range of consular services the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited, and those services, including U.S. passports and Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, may require significantly more processing time than at U.S. embassies or consulates outside Syria U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if at all possible. &nbsp;U.S. citizens who remain in Syria and require consular services may contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus at <a href="mailto:USIS_damascus@embassy.mzv.cz">USIS_damascus@embassy.mzv.cz</a>. <br> <br> U.S. citizens in Syria who are in need of emergency assistance and are unable to reach the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czech Republic, or must make contact outside business hours, should contact the <a href="https://jo.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/emergency-contact/">U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan</a>:<br> <br> Telephone: +962 (6) 590-6950 (Daily 2-3:30 local time)<br> Emergencies: +962 (6) 590-6500<br> E-mail: <a href="mailto:Amman-ACS@state.gov">Amman-ACS@state.gov</a> <br> <br> For additional information about U.S. citizens' services in Syria from the Office of Overseas Citizens' Services in Washington, e-mail: <a href="mailto:SyriaEmergencyUSC@state.gov">SyriaEmergencyUSC@state.gov</a>. <br> <br> For information on &quot;What the Department of State Can and Can't Do in a Crisis,&quot; please visit the Bureau of Consular Affairs' <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/crisis-support.html">Emergencies and Crisis link</a> at <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/">Travel.State.Gov</a>.

<title>Afghanistan Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 20:55:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/afghanistan-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/afghanistan-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens.<p>This replaces the Travel Warning issued October 5, 2016.</p><p>Travel to all areas of Afghanistan remains unsafe due to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage taking, military combat operations, landmines, banditry, armed rivalry between political and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, suicide bombings, and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other improvised explosive devices (IED). Attacks may also target official Afghan and U.S. government convoys and compounds, foreign embassies, military installations, commercial entities, non-governmental organization (NGO) offices, restaurants, hotels, airports, and educational centers.&nbsp;</p><p>Extremists associated with various Taliban networks, ISIS, and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the country. ISIS has demonstrated its operational capability, having attacked both Afghan and foreign government facilities. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, Coalition, and U.S. targets with little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties. On January 12, 2017, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham-Khorosan (ISIS-K) carried out a suicide bomb attack on a mosque, killing 30 and wounding 70. On February 7, 2017, the Afghan Supreme Court was attacked by an insurgent who detonated a suicide vest, killing more than 20 people.&nbsp; On March 1, 2017, Taliban insurgents conducted a complex attack on two separate Afghan police stations in the Kabul area, killing seven and wounding 24. On March 8, 2017, ISIS-K conducted a complex attack on the Afghan National Army Hospital in Kabul City killing more than 50 and wounding more than 90.</p><p>Two professors, one American and one Australian, from the American University in Afghanistan were reported kidnapped in Kabul in August 2016. One Australian and one Spanish NGO worker were kidnapped in November and December 2016. A U.S citizen journalist working for National Public Radio and his Afghan assistant were killed when they came under attack in Helmand Province in June 2016, and in August 2016, insurgents fired a rocket at a bus carrying EU and U.S. citizen tourists in Herat Province, wounding six people.</p><p>Due to security concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. government employees and their family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the Department of State. Furthermore, U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to all locations in Kabul except the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. government facilities unless there is a compelling U.S. government interest in permitting such travel that outweighs the risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For further background information regarding FAA flight advisories and prohibitions for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy's ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is severely limited, particularly outside of Kabul. U.S. citizens are encouraged to defer non-essential travel within Afghanistan and note that evacuation options from Afghanistan are extremely limited due to the lack of infrastructure, geographic constraints, and other security concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the Department of State&#8217;s <a href="http://travel.state.gov">Consular Affairs&#8217; website</a> where the <a href="/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, <a href="/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Alerts and Travel Warnings</a> can be found for the latest security information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Enroll in <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/step.html">STEP</a> to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy, located at Great Massoud Road (also known as Bibi Mahru or Airport Road) between Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA) and the Ministry of Public Health. The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy can be reached at 301-490-1042, ext. 8499 from the United States, or +93(0) 70-011-4000 from abroad during business hours, Sunday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Kabul time. For after-hours, truly exigent emergencies involving U.S. citizens, please contact the Embassy Duty Officer at +93-(0)70-011-4000. Any routine consular correspondence relating to services for U.S. citizens may be sent to <a href="mailto:KabulACS@state.gov">KabulACS@state.gov</a>.</li><li>Call 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).</li></ul>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Eritrea.<p>The Government of Eritrea restricts the travel of all foreign nationals in the country, including U.S. diplomats. These restrictions make it difficult for the U.S. Embassy to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside the city of Asmara. This replaces the Travel Warning dated August 26, 2016.</p><p>U.S. citizens are strongly advised to avoid travel near the Eritrean-Ethiopian border and the Southern Red Sea Region because of the presence of large numbers of Eritrean and Ethiopian troops along the contested border area, and because of the military tensions between the two countries. In June 2016, fighting in this region resulted in numerous deaths.

<title>Lebanon Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 14:03:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/lebanon-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/lebanon-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence, especially near Lebanon&#8217;s borders with Syria and Israel.<p>U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks. This supersedes the Travel Warning issued on July 29, 2016.</p><p>In the event that the security climate in Lebanon worsens, U.S. citizens will be responsible for arranging their own travel out of Lebanon. The Embassy does not offer protection services to U.S. citizens who feel unsafe. U.S. citizens with special medical or other needs should be aware of the risks of remaining given their condition, and should be prepared to seek treatment in Lebanon if they cannot arrange for travel out of the country.</p><p>There is potential for death or injury in Lebanon because of terrorist bombings and attacks. Violent extremist groups operate in Lebanon, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations Hizballah, ISIL (Da&#8217;esh), Al-Nusrah Front (ANF), Hamas, and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades (AAB). ISIL and ANF have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon in the past. The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury as a non-targeted bystander.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence, which can occur at any time in Lebanon. Armed clashes have occurred along the Lebanese borders and in Beirut. On August 31, 2016, a bomb exploded on a main road near the eastern Lebanese city of Zahleh, killing at least one person and wounding 11 others. On June 27, 2016, a series of blasts caused by suicide bombers in Qa&#8217;a, a town along Lebanon&#8217;s northeastern border, killed five people and injured many others. On June 12, 2016, an explosion occurred outside a commercial bank in the central Beirut area of Verdun, causing major damage to the building and injuring two people. On November 12, 2015, twin suicide bombings in a commercial and residential area of the Burj al-Barajneh neighborhood in Beirut&#8217;s southern suburbs killed 43 people and wounded 239 others. On January 21, 2017, Lebanese security forces thwarted an attempted suicide attack at a busy caf&#233; on Hamra Street in downtown Beirut. The Lebanese Armed Forces are routinely brought in to quell the violence in these situations.</p><p>Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Also, celebratory gunfire in Lebanon has resulted in accidental injuries and deaths. In Tripoli, the neighborhoods of Bab al-Tabbaneh&nbsp;and Jabal Mohsen remain tense. Armed clashes have resulted in deaths and injuries in these neighborhoods in the past, and there are potentially large numbers of weapons in the hands of non-governmental elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Public demonstrations can occur with little warning and could become violent. You should avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. Protesters have blocked major roads to gain publicity for their causes, including the primary road between downtown Beirut and Rafiq Hariri International Airport. Access to the airport may be cut off if the security situation deteriorates.&nbsp;</p><p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations. The U.S. government&#8217;s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is limited. Although the U.S. government places the highest priority on the safe recovery of kidnapped U.S. citizens, it is U.S. policy not to make concessions to hostage takers. U.S. law makes it illegal to provide material support to terrorist organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>AREAS OF SPECIAL CONCERN</p><p>Avoid the Lebanon-Syria border region: U.S. citizens in Lebanon should monitor political and security developments in both Lebanon and Syria. The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region. There have been incidents of cross-border shelling and air strikes of Lebanese villages from Syria, resulting in deaths and injuries. There have been episodic clashes between the Lebanese Army and Syrian-based extremists along the border with Syria since August 2014. On March 24, 2016, a roadside bomb targeting a Lebanese Armed Forces patrol killed a Lebanese soldier and wounded several others in Lebanon&#8217;s restive northeast border town of Arsal. On November 5, 2015, a deadly blast ripped through Arsal, killing at least four people and wounding several others. The November attack, caused by a suicide bomber using a motorbike, targeted a meeting in the al-Sabil neighborhood of the Committee of Qalamoun Scholars. The next day, a Lebanese Armed Forces patrol in al-Sabil was targeted by a roadside explosive device. There have also been reports of armed groups from Syria kidnapping or attacking Lebanese citizens living in border areas.</p><p>Avoid the Lebanon-Israel border region: There are border tensions to the south with Israel, and the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid this border. In January 2015, hostilities between Israel and Hizballah flared in the Golan Heights and Shebaa Farms area, and the potential for wider conflict remains. South of the Litani River, Hizballah has stockpiled large amounts of munitions in anticipation of a future conflict with Israel. There have been sporadic rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel in connection with the violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. These attacks, normally consisting of rockets fired at northern Israel, often provoke a prompt Israeli military response. The rocket attacks and responses can occur without warning. Landmines and unexploded ordnance pose significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, particularly south of the Litani River, as well as in areas of the country where fighting was intense during the civil war. More than 40 civilians have been killed and more than 300 injured by unexploded ordnance since the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war. Travelers should watch for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all areas where landmines and unexploded ordnance may be present.</p><p>Avoid the Bekaa Valley: Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to occur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions.&nbsp; Hizballah maintains a strong presence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. Hizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the Asad regime in Syria.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoid travel to refugee camps: Violence within refugee camps has resulted in shootings and explosions. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to refugee camps.&nbsp; Palestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the United States operate autonomously in formal and informal refugee camps in different areas of the country. On April 12, 2016, a car bomb explosion killed a senior Palestinian official near the Ein al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in the southern port city of Sidon.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on airlines that fly over Syria. Commercial aircraft are at risk when flying over regions in conflict. We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens considering air travel overseas evaluate the route that their proposed commercial flight may take and avoid any flights that pass through Syrian airspace. U.S. government personnel in Lebanon have been prohibited from taking flights that pass through Syrian airspace.&nbsp;</p><p>The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice. These practices limit, and may prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas of the country, especially to parts of metropolitan Beirut, Tripoli, the Bekaa Valley, refugee camps, and southern Lebanon.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. government-facilitated evacuations, such as the evacuation that took place from Lebanon in 2006, occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist, and they are not guaranteed even when commercial travel options are limited or non-existent. Evacuation assistance is provided on a cost-recovery basis, which means the traveler must reimburse the U.S. government for travel costs. U.S. citizens in Lebanon should ensure that they have valid U.S. passports, as lack of documentation could hinder U.S. citizens' ability to depart the country.

<title>El Salvador Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2017 23:42:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/el-salvador-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/el-salvador-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to El Salvador due to the high rates of crime and violence.<p>El Salvador has one of the highest homicide levels in the world and crimes such as extortion, assault and robbery are common. This replaces the Travel Warning for El Salvador dated January 15, 2016.</p><p>Gang activity is widespread in El Salvador. There are thousands of gang members operating in the country, including members of Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Eighteenth Street (M18). Gangs (<i>maras</i>) focus on extortion, violent street crime, narcotics and arms trafficking. Muggings following ATM or bank withdrawals are common, as are armed robberies at scenic-view stops (<i>miradores</i>). While the majority of the violence occurs between rival gangs and there is no information to suggest U.S. citizens are specifically targeted, its pervasiveness increases the chance of being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to armed robberies in national parks, we strongly recommend that hikers in back country areas engage local guides certified by the national or local tourist authority. The <a href="http://www.pnc.gob.sv/">National Civilian Police</a> (PNC) has a special tourist police force (POLITUR) to provide security and assistance to visitors. More information can be found on <a href="http://politurelsalvador.com/">POLITUR&#8217;s website</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Remain alert to your surroundings, especially when entering or exiting homes, hotels, cars, garages, schools, and workplaces. When possible, travel in groups. U.S. Embassy personnel are advised not to walk, run, or cycle in unguarded streets and parks, even in groups. Avoid wearing expensive jewelry, and do not carry large sums of money or display cash, ATM/credit cards, or other valuables. Avoid walking at night in most areas of El Salvador. Motorists should avoid traveling at night. Drive with windows up and doors locked to deter robberies. Avoid travel on public transportation, especially buses, both within and outside the capital. Only use radio-dispatched taxis or those stationed in front of major hotels.</p><p>For further information:</p><ul><li>See the&nbsp;State Department's <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">travel website&nbsp;</a>for the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Warnings</a>, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html">Travel Alerts</a>, and&nbsp;El Salvador&#8217;s <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/el-salvador.html">Country Specific Information</a>.</li><li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="http://step.state.gov/step">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&nbsp;(STEP)</a> to receive security messages and make it easier for us to locate you in an emergency.</li><li>Contact the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, located at Final Boulevard Santa Elena Sur, Urbanizaci&#243;n Santa Elena, Antiguo Cuscatl&#225;n, La Libertad, by email at <a href="mailto:ACSSanSal@state.gov">ACSSanSal@state.gov</a><u> or by phone at </u>503-2501-2999, or visit our <a href="https://sv.usembassy.gov/embassy/san-salvador/">website</a>.</li><li>Call 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).</li><li>Follow us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/embajadaamericanaelsalvador">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/USCitSV">Twitter</a>.</li></ul>]]></description>

<title>Libya Travel Warning</title><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2017 19:54:00 EST</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/libya-travel-warning.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/libya-travel-warning.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Libya and recommends that U.S. citizens currently in Libya depart immediately.<p>On July 26, 2014, the U.S. Embassy suspended all embassy operations in Libya and relocated staff outside of the country because of violence between Libyan militias.&nbsp; The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli remains closed, and the security situation in Libya remains unpredictable and unstable. U.S. citizens in Libya should make contingency emergency plans and maintain situational awareness at all times. This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning issued on June 9, 2016.</p><p>On July 26, 2014 the U.S. Embassy suspended operations in Libya. The Department of State has extremely limited capacity to assist U.S. citizens in Libya.</p><p>Please direct inquiries regarding U.S. citizens in Libya to LibyaACS@state.gov.&nbsp; Callers in the United States and Canada may dial the toll free number 1-888-407-4747. Callers outside the United States and Canada may dial 1-202-501-4444.</p><p>Recent worldwide terrorism alerts, including the Department of State&#8217;s Worldwide Caution, have stated that extremist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in the Middle East region, including Libya.</p><p>Tripoli and other cities have witnessed fighting between armed groups and government forces as well as terrorist attacks. Hotels frequented by westerners have been caught in the crossfire.&nbsp; Militia controlled checkpoints are common.&nbsp; Militia groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times but be aware that these documents do not guarantee fair treatment. The Department of State has extremely limited capacity to assist U.S. citizens who are detained in Libya.</p><p>Most international airports are closed, and flights out of operational airports are sporadic and may be cancelled without warning. On December 23, 2016 an airplane traveling from Sabha to Tripoli was hijacked and diverted to Malta by armed men threatening to blow up the plane.&nbsp; The U.S. government is very concerned about the targeting of commercial transportation in Libya, and prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.&nbsp; Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For further background information regarding FAA flight advisories and prohibitions for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.</p><p>Seaports and roads can also close with little or no warning. Violence in Libya against civilian commercial interests raises serious concerns about the safety of maritime vessels and their crews. The Libyan National Army (LNA) announced on January 7, 2015 that all vessels in Libyan waters require LNA approval for transit, following the January 4, 2015 bombing of a Greek-operated oil tanker that killed two crewmen near Derna, Libya. Vessels are advised to proceed with extreme caution when approaching all Libyan oil terminals and ports.&nbsp; Mariners planning travel to Libya should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts.&nbsp; Updates may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website, and the NGA broadcast warnings website (select &#8220;broadcast warnings&#8221;) advisories.&nbsp;</p><p>Violent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and extremist groups have made threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests. Threats against U.S. citizens may include murder or kidnapping. ISIL claimed responsibility for two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices in Tripoli in September 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. citizens should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests, as even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom.</p><p>If travel in the desert or border regions of Libya is critically necessary, exercise caution and comply with local regulations. Terrorist organizations, including Islamic State-affiliated groups and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, continue to threaten the region.&nbsp; Recent terrorist attacks have occurred in the border region, where extremists have kidnapped Westerners, most recently two Italians and a Canadian citizen in September 2016.

<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to the border area between Somalia and Kenya because of threats by the terrorist group al-Shabaab. <p>U.S. citizens should also be aware of potential terrorist threats and the high risk of crime throughout the country.&nbsp; This replaces the Travel Warning dated June 30, 2016.</p><p>For your safety:</p><ul><li>Avoid travel in the northeastern Kenyan counties of Mandera, Wajir and Garissa, the coastal counties of Tana River and Lamu in their entirety, all areas north of Malindi in Kilifi County, and the Nairobi neighborhood of Eastleigh.</li><li>In Mombasa, the U.S. Embassy recommends U.S. citizens visit Old Town only during daylight hours, and avoid using the Likoni ferry due to safety concerns.</li></ul><p>In 2016, terrorist attacks involving shootings, grenades, or other explosive devices resulted in 122 fatalities.
